# BGUM 2019 basic tutorial

If you found this page looking for _the_ tutorial, follow [this

The last day of [BGUM 2019](/BGUM2019) was dedicated to doing
tutorials. During the basic beginners-tutorial session we aimed to create a
simple diffusion problem. Piece by piece, we coded and discussed some
considerations for the following example:

* [A simple diffusion problem in Basilisk. (including some
discussion)](diff.c)

Then we extended this code to run with a space-varyimg diffusivity and
employed an adaptive grid for the computations:

* [An extended simple diffusion problem.](diff_v.c)

We also discussed some general concepts regarding the various grids
types in Baslisk.

* [As also presented here](/sandbox/Antoonvh/The_Tree_Grid_Structure_in_Basilsik)

Due to a lack of time we did not do the following exersizes:

* [Implement "our own" diffusion solver](diffusion2.h)

* [Test this new solver formulation](diff2.c)

## Repeated message:

It is wise to learn from *all* of the [examples](/src/examples/README)
and read the documentation that comes along with the [solver and
functions](/src/README) that you `#include`.
