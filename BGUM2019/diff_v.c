/**
# Tutorial part 2: Variable diffusivity and an adaptive grid

Here we extend the code from the [more simple diffusion
example](diff.c) and set a variable diffusivity and use an adaptive
grid. Please note the note in the corresponding event.

Results:

![The evolution of the scalar field `s`](diff_v/s.mp4)

![The level of refinement](diff_v/level.mp4)
