# The Rayleigh-Taylor instability and the 'Black body' colourbar

Inspired by the reference for the so-called 'cool-warm' colourbar, I
visited the website of [Kenneth
Moreland](http://www.kennethmoreland.com/color-advice/) and found that
the 'black body' colour bar is simply stunning. We examplify it with
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability:

![A nice colourbar not only helps with the interpretation of data, it can also help
 expand the artistic freedom for visualizations](rt/rt.png)

This looks an awfull lot like [this $\mu$-HH based
video](https://vimeo.com/84675235), which puts the artistic 'freedom'
argument into its perspective.
